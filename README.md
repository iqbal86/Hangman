Hangman Game

Game rules

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, giving the number of letters, numbers and category.

If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the computer will write it in all its correct positions.

If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the computer will draw one element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

The game is over when: 

 -The guessing player completes the word
 
 -The program completes the diagram
